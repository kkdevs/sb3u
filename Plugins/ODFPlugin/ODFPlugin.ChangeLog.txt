[0.5.5]
  - Fix for Center View in the renderer for ODF meshes (most of them).
  - Loading and saving ODF and ODA is a bit faster, and allow the complete removal of the source file.
  - Again! Automatic imports of materials and textures chose incorrect imported ones when not all submeshes were replaced.

[0.5.4]
  - Fix for morph exports of ODFs using Skip Unused Profiles and Replace Normals gets set according to normals being imported.
  - Added storing the last chosen mesh export format
  - Fixed setting wrong target mesh frame in the replacing options upon dropping the mesh into an unused area of the Object Tree.
  - Fix for many operations which were modifying the Object Tree.
  - Added retaining order of bone lists (one reason for partial morphing from ALP).
  - Fixed data corruption in ODFs upon replacing (adding) a submesh.
  - Automatic imports of materials and textures chose incorrect imported ones when not all submeshes were replaced.
  - Support for RLE compressed TGAs when rendering
  - Fixed MQO export didn't export all textures when one texture caused an error. Same for Morph MQOs.

[0.5.3]
  - Added, expanded nodes in the Object Tree are expanded after all actions
  - Imported meshes and can be dragged into the Mesh View for replacement. (Also frames.)
  - Dragging a mesh from the Object Tree into the Workspace,
    drags the mesh frame instead and all used materials and textures.

[0.4.42.53]
  - Added Zero Check for identifying unknowns
  - Found new unknown field, separated more AlwaysZero fields
  - Stability fixes for missing ODF sections
  - Fixed after deleting submeshes the Object Tree wasn't updated and produced crashes when a node of a bone was clicked.

[0.4.42.52]
  - Fixed ODF corruption after use of CopyBonesNear and CopyBonesOrder
  - Fixed crash when replacing meshes which used non existing materials
  - Fixed "cant rename submesh without renaming another" after replacing meshes
  - Changed replacing animations considers a start position in "Replace Mode"
  - Added "Replace Present Mode" for replacing animations
  - Added unknowns of submeshes can be changed
  - Changed replacing animations: rotations are multiplied by -1

[0.4.42.50]
  - Nameless meshes are exported using their id as name

[0.4.42.39]
  - imported meshes can be easier placed into destination frames

[0.4.42.34]
  - Added clicking animation tracks highlights the corresponding bone.

[0.4.42.32]
  - fixed crashes for Renai+H : Replacing meshes from workspace (imported and from open ODFs)
  - removed misleading error message having a mesh id twice during replacing meshes

[0.4.42.24]
  - removed 8.3 filename export option for FBX
  - changed FBX export to common FBX exporter
  - added animation export/import
  - removed ODFPluginFBX

[0.4.42.22]
  - menu options for REM persistent in DLL config file
  - Center View corrected
  - useless editor.Set{Frame|Material|Texture}Name() no longer invoked
  - removed unused importers for MQO and FBX

[0.4.42.18]
  - freeing scripting variables

[0.4.42.9]
  - MQO export with world coordinates failed
  - MQO import always failed
  - Renderer crashed for meshes with missing textures
    (head meshes having wrong extentions in textures)

[0.4.42.8]
  - added replacing morphs
  - materials and textures merged from workspace

[0.4.42.7]
  - ODF/ODA animations are shown

[p133]
  - ODF animations are shown
